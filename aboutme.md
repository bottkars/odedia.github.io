Hi there! I'm Oded.

I work for Pivotal as a Senior Platform Architect, spreading the message of Cloud Native development, Pivotal Cloud Foundry and App Transformation.
I helped design large-scale, cloud-native microservices solutions running on Pivotal Cloud Foundry and developed with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

I'm highly skilled in Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Apache Kafka, Event Sourcing and DevOps practices.

I enjoy photography, video editing, and the music of the King of Pop.
